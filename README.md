ChatGPT (OpenAI)

How I Used AI

I used ChatGPT as a development assistant throughout this project in the following ways:

To generate initial boilerplate code for FastAPI routes, Pydantic schemas, and React components.
To brainstorm REST API endpoint design and clean folder structure for a full-stack application.
To debug runtime errors, such as database connection issues, JWT authentication problems, CORS configuration, and bcrypt compatibility issues.
To draft unit test structures using pytest and identify important edge cases for inventory and authentication logic.
To help design and refine frontend UI layouts for login, registration, and the sweets dashboard using React.

My Reflection on AI Usage
AI significantly accelerated my development workflow by reducing time spent on repetitive setup tasks and providing quick guidance when debugging issues. 
However, I ensured that I fully understood all AI-generated code, manually reviewed it, and made necessary adjustments to fit the project requirements. 
Core logic, architectural decisions, and final implementations were always validated and refined by me. AI acted as a productivity tool rather than a replacement for my own problem-solving and decision-making.
